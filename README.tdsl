have the egg json in this repo as well, egg script just clones and merges, then runs install.sh in here


maybe use https://github.com/ribasco/async-gamequery-lib somehow? with rcon access to server, could be good?

or maybe one of the many impls here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries
maybe make pod out of go one?

maybe https://github.com/koraktor/steam-condenser-java
